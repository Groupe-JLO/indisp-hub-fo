# Indispensables Front-end

Indispensables is a little web app built with ReactJS allowing e-learning team to creare "mini-hubs" for their e-learning courses, by adding one or many modules to the clients and track visits on the hub using Google Analytics.

## Important informations

Please consider refactoring this repository (and indisp-hub_bo) as they are not built with modern, up-to-date and maintainable technologies used by the JLO Dev team. Consider rebuilding it into the com-rh management interface alongside Sensidiag and Clap'n'click.

## Hosting

Indispensable front-end is hosted on the HPI VPS from OVH, Running in an Nginx container. For more informations to acces this VPS, please contact the developers team
